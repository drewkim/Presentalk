Presentalk

By Graham, Chanan, Drew, Ryan, and Kyle

Overview

● Web-based, voice-controlled presentations
● Allows upload of a PDF file of your presentation
● Gives mic access and uses voice commands to control the presentation

Voice Control

● Uses the Python SpeechRecognition library 

○ Defaults to Google Speech Recognition API
○ Backup is IBM Watson Speech to Text

● Thanks to multithreading, microphone is always active in the background
● Commands require the trigger “slide” to avoid accidentally changing slides
● Can go forward, back, or to a specific slide number
● Examples: 

○
○
○

“Go back a slide”
“Go to the next slide”
“Go to slide number 4”

More Advanced Functionality

● We implemented computer vision using the Google Cloud Vision API so that 
we can jump to slides with certain pictures on them. Remember the dog on 
the Overview slide? Let’s go to the slide with the dog.

Other technologies

● The PDFMiner package scrapes text and images from the slides to power the 

ML image search and text search, e.g. go to the Voice Control slide 

● Flask framework controls web infrastructure for the Python back-end
● Commands are parsed using regular expressions
